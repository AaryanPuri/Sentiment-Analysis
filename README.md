## 📌 Project Overview

In an era where data drives decisions, the educational sector often lacks a structured approach to analyze and act on student feedback. This project aims to bridge that gap by leveraging **Sentiment Analysis** and **PowerBI** to extract insights from student sentiments, enhancing institutional strategies and improving learning experiences.

> “Understanding student emotions isn't optional—it's essential.”

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Current educational systems fail to incorporate real-time sentiment analysis of students and stakeholders. This hinders content optimization and decision-making processes.

> 🔍 **Goal**: Use NLP and visualization tools to generate actionable insights that support personalized learning and enhance content delivery.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze student feedback using sentiment analysis.
- Visualize trends using **PowerBI dashboards**.
- Automate data extraction from various sources.
- Suggest improvements to academic content and teaching methods.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

### ⚙️ Tools & Languages

- **Python** – Core programming
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Prototyping and experimentation
- **PowerBI** – Interactive dashboards and data visualization
- **BeautifulSoup, Selenium, Requests** – Web scraping tools
- **NLTK, TextBlob, re** – Natural Language Processing libraries

## 🏗️ Methodology

1. **Web Scraping** – Extract student feedback from various educational platforms.
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, lemmatization.
3. **Sentiment Analysis** – Using NLP libraries to detect polarity and emotional tone.
4. **Model Training** – Algorithms like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and SVM.
5. **Evaluation Metrics** – Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, Sentiment Distribution.
6. **Visualization** – Dashboards created using PowerBI for stakeholder insights.
